    <!-- //transform -->
    <!-- <h1>Put your <span>dukes</span> up, sire</h1>
    The translate(x,y) function moves an element x from the left, and y from the top:
    transform: translate(45px, -45px);
    If you only want to move an element vertically or horizontally, 
    you can use the translatex or translatey functions respectively. To move 45px to the right along the x axis, include:
    transform: translateX(45px);
    To move up along the y axis by 30px, include
    transform: translateY(-30px); -->
    <!-- //scaling
    The scale(x,y) function scales an element by the defined factors horizontally then vertically.
    transform: scale(1.5, 0.25); -->
    <!-- //rotation
    The rotate() function rotates an element around the point of origin by a specified angle value.
    Generally, angles are declared in degrees, with positive degrees moving clockwise and negative 
    moving counterclockwise. In addition to degrees, values can be provided in grads, radians, or turns, but we’ll just be sticking with degrees. -->
    <!-- //Skew
    The skew(x,y) function specifies a skew along the x and y axes. As you’d expect, the x specifies the skew on the x axis, 
    and the y specifies the skew on the y axis. If the second parameter is omitted, the skew will only occur on the x axis:
    transform: skew(15deg, 4deg);
    !!The order of transform functions does matter: if you rotate before translating, your translate direction will be on the rotated axis. -->
    <!-- //transformIf you want to transition more than one property, but not all, comma-separate them:
    .foo {
        transition-property: transform, color;
    }
    //transition-duration Property
    the duration of time it takes to go from the default state to the transitioned state. You can specify this either in seconds (s) or milliseconds (ms). 
    We’d like our animation to be fairly quick, so we’ll specify 0.2 seconds (0.2s), or 200 milliseconds (200ms):
    200ms is generally considered the optimum time for a transition: anything slower will make the website seem slow.

        transition-delay: 50ms;
    }
    to this
    .ad-ad2 h1 span {
        transition: transform 0.2s ease-out 50ms;

    Shorthandtransition: transform 0.2s ease-out 50ms, color 0.1s linear 50ms;
     -->
     <!-- //Animations
     We use @keyframes. For an animation called myAnimation, the @keyframes rule would look like this:
     @-webkit-keyframes myAnimation { 
        /* put animation keyframes here */
    }
    @keyframes myAnimation { 
        /* put animation keyframes here */
    }
    Keyframes can be specified in any order; 
    it’s the percentage values rather than the order of the declarations that determine the sequence of keyframes in the animation.
    @keyframes moveRight { 
        from {
        transform: translateX(-50%);
        }
        to {
        transform: translateX(50%);
        }
    }
    
    @keyframes appearDisappear { 
        0%, 100% {
        opacity: 0;
        }
        20%, 80% {
        opacity: 1;
        }
    }
    
    @keyframes bgMove {
        100% {
        background-position: 120% 0;
        }
    } -->
    <!-- //Animation Properties
The animation properties, remembering that you will need two declarations for each property as 
the -webkit- prefix is still needed in WebKit browsers, are as follows:
animation-name
Note that you should not put quotes around the animation name in either the property value or
 the @keyframes at-rule, as the specifications state the name is an identifier and not a string, 
 so browsers don’t support quoted animation names.
 The animation-duration property defines the length of time (in seconds or milliseconds) 
 an animation takes to complete one iteration (all the way through, from 0% to 100%):
 animation-duration: 300ms;
//animation-timing-function
 Like the transition-timing-function property, the animation-timing-function determines how the 
 animation will progress over its duration. The options are the same as for transition-timing-function: 
 ease, linear, ease-in, ease-out, ease-in-out, a developer-defined cubic-bezier() function, step-start, 
 step-end, or a developer-defined number of steps with the steps(number, direction) function:
 animation-timing-function: linear;
//animation-iteration-count
he animation-iteration-count property lets you define how many times the animation will play through. 
The value is generally an integer, but you can also use numbers with decimal points
animation-iteration-count: infinite;
//animation-delay
The animation-delay property is used to define how many milliseconds or seconds 
to wait before the browser begins the animation:
animation-delay: 50ms;
animation-fill-mode
//The Shorthand animation Property
.verbose {
    animation-name: appearDisappear; 
    animation-duration: 300ms; 
    animation-timing-function: ease-in;
    animation-iteration-count: 1;
    animation-direction: alternate;
    animation-delay: 5s;
    animation-fill-mode: backwards;
    animation-play-state: running;
}

/* shorthand */
.concise {
    animation: 300ms ease-in alternate 5s backwards appearDisappear;
}
To declare multiple animations on an element, 
include a grouping for each animation name, with each shorthand grouping separated by a comma. For example:
.target {
    animation: 
    animationOne 300ms ease-in backwards, 
    animationTwo 600ms ease-out 1s forwards;
}

    0% {

    }
    100% {

    }
}
@keyframes move {
    0% {
    transform: translateX(-100px);
    }
    100% {
    transform: translateX(100px);
